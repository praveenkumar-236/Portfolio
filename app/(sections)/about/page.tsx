          I am a passionate full-stack Java developer with experience in
          building innovative and scalable web applications.
          <br />
          <br />I have experience working as a
          <span className="font-semibold mx-2">Software Developer.</span>
          As a developer, I create quality software solutions for clients across
          various domains and industries. With a team of talented engineers, I
          design and develop web applications that combine user-friendly
          interfaces, robust functionalities, and high performance, using Java,
          Spring Boot, React.js, Bootstrap, MySQL, and MongoDB.
          <br />
          <br />
          I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from
          KLN College of Engineering, where I gained a solid foundation in data
          structures, algorithms, and software engineering principles.
          <br />
          <br />
          I also earned multiple certifications in Frontend and Backend
          demonstrating my skills and proficiency in various programming
          languages and tools. I enjoy learning new technologies and enhancing
          my abilities, such as using Elasticsearch, a powerful search and
          analytics engine, to index, query, and analyze large volumes of data.
          I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence and machine
          learning, and I am eager to explore how they can be applied to
          software development. I am looking for opportunities to work on
          challenging and diverse projects, collaborate with other
          professionals, and grow as a developer and a learner.
